<h1>“There Will Come Soft Rain” by Sara Teasdale</h1>
<p>There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,<br />
    And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;<br />
    And frogs in the pools singing at night,<br />
    And wild plum trees in tremulous white;<br />
    Robins will wear their feathery fire,<br />
    Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;<br />
    And not one will know of the war, not one<br />
    Will care at last when it is done.<br />
    Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,<br />
    If mankind perished utterly;<br />
    And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn<br />
    Would scarcely know that we were gone.<br /></p>
